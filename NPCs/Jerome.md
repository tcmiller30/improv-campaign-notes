An Adventurer's Patron.

We found Jerome speaking to passer-by's through a statue, asking them to answer the call to adventure. We did and were sent to [[Drubbin]] to deal with a gnoll problem and save [[Mayor Cool]].

His living space under the statue was very nice and seemed very out of place.

Disclosed that he was cursed/poisoned by a hag named [[Agatha Skooble]]. The curse fried his nervous system and he was unable to continue adventuring so he instead arranges adventures for others.
