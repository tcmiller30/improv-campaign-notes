Gnomes are ranching giant snails on a small homestead. The ranchers name is Don Hooda, his wife's name is Lisa. They harvest the mucus for use in drinks, soups, and other goods.

The snails' names are:
- Misty

The ranchers lost a snail the previous night, claiming a devil of some sort is gnawing through the enclosure and stealing snails in the night.

They used to have a dog, but it left them to start a family of its own. The dog and its pups still visit on holidays.
