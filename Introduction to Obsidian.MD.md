Obsidian is a powerful and flexible note-taking application that allows you to organize your campaign notes using **Markdown**, a lightweight and easy-to-use formatting language. This guide will introduce you to the basics of Obsidian and how to use it effectively for tracking your D&D adventures.

## 📖 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to format text that works seamlessly in Obsidian. Instead of complicated menus, you can use plain text symbols to add headings, bold, italics, links, and more.

### Basic Markdown Syntax

|Format|Syntax|Example Output|
|---|---|---|
|**Bold**|`**text**`|**Paladin**|
|_Italic_|`*text*`|_Feywild_|
|`Code`|`` `text` ``|`1d20 + 5`|
|~~Strikethrough~~|`~~text~~`|~~Failed save~~|
|[Link](#)|`[Link Text](url)`|[Obsidian Website](https://obsidian.md)|

### Example:

```
**Character Name:** Frodo Baggins
*Class:* Rogue
*Quest:* Destroy The One Ring
```

This will render as:

**Character Name:** Frodo Baggins
_Class:_ Rogue
_Quest:_ Destroy The One Ring

## 📚 Organizing Your Notes

Obsidian allows you to create a "vault" to store all your notes. You can structure your notes to keep track of characters, locations, quests, and lore.

### Suggested Folder Structure

```
D&D Vault
├── 📜 Characters
│    ├── Gandalf the Grey.md
│    └── Frodo Baggins.md
├── 📍 Locations
│    ├── Mount Doom.md
│    └── Minas Tirith.md
└── 🗺️ Quests
     ├── Destroy The One Ring.md
     └── Travel to Isengard.md
```

Use folders and subfolders to keep your notes tidy and easy to navigate.

---

## 🔗 Linking Notes

One of Obsidian's most powerful features is **internal linking**. You can connect related notes using `[[double brackets]]`.

### Example:

In your "Frodo Baggins" note, you might write:

```
Frodo's current quest is to [[Destroy The One Ring]] in the lava of [[Mount Doom]].
```

Clicking on these links will take you directly to those notes.

## 📊 Creating Lists and Tables

Lists and tables are useful for tracking items, NPCs, and other game details.

### Lists

- Active Quests:
    - Destroy The One Ring
    - Meet With Saruman in Isengard

### Tables

|Item|Description|
|---|---|
|Potion of Healing|Restores 2d4 + 2 HP|
|Magicite Shard|Faintly glows with energy|

---

## ✅ Task Management

Use checkboxes to track tasks and quests.

```
- [x] Meet with Saruman at Isengard
- [ ] Avoid Smeagol
```

This renders as:

- [x]  Meet with Saruman at Isengard
- [ ]  Avoid Smeagol

## 🔍 Useful Tips

- **Quickly Find Notes:** Use `Ctrl + O` (or `Cmd + O` on Mac) to open the Quick Switcher and find any note instantly.
- **Tag Notes:** Add `#tag` to organize and filter notes. For example, `#NPC` or `#Quest`.
- **Templates:** Create templates for recurring note formats (e.g., character sheets, session summaries).
- **Toggle Edit Mode** You can switch between edit and read mode using the button at the top right of this panel. If you are in ***Edit Mode***, the button will look like a book to *switch to Preview Mode*. If you are in ***Preview Mode***, the button will look like a pencil to *switch to Edit Mode*
