Some snails at [[Hooda's Giant Snail Farm]] have turned up killed in recent nights.

Investigating the remains showed claw marks on the body of the snail and a puncture wound on the shell.

The attacks have only been occurring recently.

Lisa Hooda claims that there was a foul scent in the air akin to rotten cabbage/produce when the attacks occurred.

Found tracks leading away from the snail enclosure. The prints seemed humanoid "if not a little longer"

Following them led us to a large hollowed out tree.

Inside the tree, we found a passage leading underground to a small chamber with a flimsy door at the end. The chamber contained some letters, most seemed nonsensical, even though they were written in common. The letters seem coded although not with a cipher. Several times, a figure named **Miss V** shows up in the letters. There are also small animal skulls scattered among the area.

We kick down the door and see a tall, gaunt figure with stringy long hair hunched in the corner fiddling with a strange orb-like object. He twists it, places it on a shelf, and rushed to attack us.
